This will house all of the upcoming project files and discoveries regarding Mantled Beasts. See www.mantledbeasts.com to start.

# Links and Stuff
https://www.printables.com/model/1111257-mantle-beast-mask - STL Mantled Beast Visor. Starting reference template.
https://youtu.be/xjmwgky0e2Q?si=_eidbPT9R8cHnfds - A DIY Project using a Raspberry Pi and an eye tracker with an OLED panel to display the pupil. Great way to introduce yourself into open source eye tracking.
https://github.com/JEOresearch/terminatorsunglasses - The repository for the above-mentioned eye tracker setup.
https://github.com/dimitrivlachos/Proto-OS - ProtoOS, Seems to not have been updated in the last few years but I reckon we can get a good head start using that software.
https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/displays?page=1 - You want to know about displays? Anything that is shiny and pretty that would probably interest a Mantled Beast? Go check this out.

# Upcoming Steps
Create ARKit face tracking/measurement application to allow us to extrapolate a .OBJ or .STL reference of our face.
Utilize the exported file to create a reference that we can use the STL Mantled Beast Visor as an overlay. Scale to appropriate proportions.
Create a shell to house the electronics. This can be printed in TPU or PETG/ABS. Need something that's resilient to heat and will not crack/destroy itself over a long period of time.
Buy the pretty color LED matricies to start testing expressions using ProtoOS as a launchpad.
Learning how to vacuum form a 3D printed shell of the visor from concept to one solid piece.

# Long Term Steps
Integrate open-source eye tracking into the system. Perhaps facial tracking, if at all possible.
Install a voice modulator, something to allow us to fully immerse ourself into the environment.
Install a VR headset, or something that can allow us to visually enhance what we're seeing in front of us, rather than looking through a dimmed visor.
  This may take some more research, as integrating a VR headset is not something you will commonly see. Perhaps understanding how fresnel/pancake lenses can come in handy here may help.

# Future steps will be added as we work on getting a baseline idea of how we want to approach this project.
